# Contributing to Gecko Grid Layout #

The following is a set of guideslines for contributing to Gecko Grid Layout.

## Getting Started ##

Honestly this is my first time doing this, so I'm going to start with the vision. Grid layout is a 12 column layout tool for theme developers. Theme developers can use it to create layouts that endusers can add to their website to make beautiful layouts!

### What it's not ###

Grid layout is not an end all for building a website. It relies on theme developers to style it and make it beautiful.
